### My Role
I aided Dr. Emily Moran and Post-Doc Melaine Aubry-Kientz in hindcasting, developing new behaviors, creating visualizations and performing analyses using newly developed parameters for individual based model, [Sortie-ND](http://www.sortie-nd.org/). 

I performed this work at the University of California - Merced from January 2019 to July 2020 as a contracted position in the Plant Ecology and Evolution Lab through the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI).

We continued to collaborate on this project and went on to publish our work in 2021 in the Annals of Forest Science: [Modeling the forest dynamics of the Sierra Nevada under climate change using SORTIE-ND](https://annforsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s13595-021-01074-z).

### Data
All data related to the figures found in this article and data related to my work is open source and can be found in my github repo: [SortieForTheSierra](https://github.com/nrvannest/SortieForTheSierra.git).

### Figures

```
  
Figure 1. Compares future climate scenarios by site (BBBPIPO, POFLABMA and UPLOG) 

  
```{r}

```
  
Figure 2. Displays the model validating results for growth (basal area) and mortality (density) at each location for each species present.  
 
  
```{r out.width='100%', out.height='100%'}

```
  
Figure 3. Describes the future mortality (density) of all tree species under two climate scenarios (right) and all climate scenarios for two species (left).
