I am a master's candidate at the University of California - Santa Barbara's Bren School 
for Environmental Science and Management, currently residing in Santa Barbara, CA. I'm interested in using environmental data to better understand forested and terrestrial ecosystems through modeling and creating compelling visuals.  
  
I also love talking about gardening, travel and cooking.
