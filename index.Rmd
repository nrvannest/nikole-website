I am a master's candidate at the University of California - Santa Barbara's Bren School 
for Environmental Science and Management, currently residing in Santa Barbara, CA.    
  
I am currently working on my thesis project - Exploring Mountain Lion Connectivity 
in Central and Southern California, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy at 
the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve.
  
I love talking about gardening, travel and plant ID.
